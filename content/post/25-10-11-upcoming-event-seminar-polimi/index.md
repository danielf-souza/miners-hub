**Does Interdisciplinarity in Research Really Generate Societal Impact? A Study of Research Collaborations in British Universities**


The project addresses the long-standing and critical question of whether the widespread promotion of interdisciplinary research (IDR) in universities genuinely translates into tangible societal impact, specifically through enhanced engagement with industry and society.

Results from a large-scale longitudinal analysis of British universities reveal that a universityâ€™s success in generating societal impact depends not simply on the presence of interdisciplinary projects alone, but is critically determined by how widely and evenly this interdisciplinarity is distributed across its entire research portfolio and knowledge domains. The impact it generates varies quite significantly on the engagement pathways undertaken, with both commercialization (through patenting and spinouts) and regional development being largely being unaffected.

However, industry contracted research, consultancies and large collaborative projects involving do get affected by the degree of interdisciplinarity, at least at the organizational level. Ongoing research continues to examine whether interdisciplinarity as a paradigm is a critical mediator between the nature of research collaborations and its eventual societal impact.
