June 17th - June 20th, 2025
The REGIS summer school is open to doctoral students and post-doctoral fellows involved in innovation and science economics. Master students with an interest in pursuing research on this topic may also participate.

Over the course of four days, course content will combine lectures and practical sessions allowing participants to discuss the most recent scientific literature and papers pertaining to this field of studies, thus developing their critical thinking skills.
