summary: "Are Cancer Drugs Worth the Price?"
abstract: 'In this talk, Professor Kyle will discuss her work, co-authored with Pierre Dubois, on the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on cancer mortality rates. Cancer is a leading cause of death in developed countries, and cancer treatments are the top category of pharmaceutical spending in the United States and Europe. This paper investigates whether novel cancer therapies reduce mortality and their cost per statistical life year saved. The study analyzes data from 24 countries and 22 cancer sites over 20 years, examining the causal relationship between the availability of approved treatments and cancer-specific mortality.'
